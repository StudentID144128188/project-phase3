        <h3> Cancel Booking</h3>
        <p>
          If you decide to cancel the booking right before the check-in, the
          full or partial sum can be charged from the card you entered when
          making the reservation. The sum depends on the property and its terms.
          In the example above, the cancellation is free but this is not common
          for all properties! If your booking cancellation implies a fine, it
          will be charged from your bank card. The fine here stands for a
          partial payment for your stay. The reason is quite obvious â€” the
          closer the date of your check-in is, the more likely the owner of the
          hotel is left with no guests. So it is a kind of penalty. The platform
          will notify you about the fine via email in case there are some
          problems with charging the money from your card. To sum up, the
          cancellation via email suits you only in case you change your mind
          within the permitted period.
